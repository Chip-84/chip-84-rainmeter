# Chip-84 Rainmeter Edition

Chip-84 is a CHIP-8/SuperCHIP-8 interpreter originally written for the TI-84 Plus CE calculator.  This is the port over to a Rainmeter Skin.  Currently, Rainmeter does not support nearest neighbor pixel interpolation so the emulation screen will appear blurry if set to a larger size than the native CHIP-8 or SCHIP-8 screen size.

## Installation

Download from releases and install using the Rainmeter skin installer.

## Usage

Right-click the emulation screen to open a context menu.  In this context menu, hover over "Custom Skin Actions" to reveal options related to Chip-84.
